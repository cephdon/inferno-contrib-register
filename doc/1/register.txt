REGISTER(1)
===========

== NAME

register - Keep given service addr/attrs registered in registry


== SYNOPSIS

----
register [-v] [[-a attr val] â€¦] addr
----


== DESCRIPTION

This command will try to keep service named 'addr' with given attributes
('attr' and 'val' pairs) registered in default registry(4) (which should
be available at */mnt/registry*). When registry is not available retry
attempt to (re-)register service every 1 second.

*-v* will increase log verbosity level.

If registry mounted from remote server it's recommended to use
retrymount(1) to make sure registry will automatically reappear in
*/mnt/registry* after any connection issues or restarting registry service.


== EXAMPLES

Static port:

----
addr=tcp!localhost!rstyx
listen -i {register -a proto rstyx $addr&} $addr {auxi/rstyxd&}
----

Dynamic port and watchdog:

----
listen -v -i {

        load std

        port  := ${hd ${tl ${split ! `{cat $net/local} } } }
        attrs := ( -a proto rstyx -a auth infpk1 )

        watchdog register -v $attrs tcp!localhost!$port

    } tcp!localhost!0 {auxi/rstyxd&}
